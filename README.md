# Usage
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

The website does not have any functionality at the moment. It only serves as a layout      
for a travel company website's landing page. However, the project utilizes javascript to   
make it more interactive and dynamic in nature like the navigation menu (ul) list is    
injected dynamically inside the navbar also the navbar collapses on small screen (mobile)   
devices and provides a toggler to open and close the navigation menu. It also uses javascript   
to provide a smooth scrolling experience and toggles the active css class to mark the section   
that is currently active.
